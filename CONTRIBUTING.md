## General Guidelines
* In an active repository, choose an open issue from the issue list, claim it in the comments, and a maintainer will assign it to you.  
* After approval you must make continuous notes on your progress in the issue while working.  If there is not at least one comment every 3 days, the maintainer can reassign the issue.
* Create a branch specific to the issue you're working on, so that you send a PR from that branch instead of the base branch on your fork.
* If youâ€™d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues. It is advisable to discuss the issue with the repo maintainers on Gitter so that your issue is not a duplicate of existing ones.
* Have a short description on what has gone wrong (like a root cause analysis and description of the fix), if that information is not already present in the issue.
* **Always reference the issue number in the commit header.**
* Also, [squash](https://github.com/wprig/wprig/wiki/How-to-squash-commits) your commits before sending a PR. This helps us to maintain a clean and organised commit history.
* If you have issues on multiple pages, report them separately. Do not combine them into a single issue.

Happy Coding!
