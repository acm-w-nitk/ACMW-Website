				<p>The ACM-W mentorship program will pair juniors with seniors from ACM. We believe that giving students the opportunity to interact with experienced people from their field will encourage them in their journey through college. </p>
				<p>As part of this mentorship system we will help participants with their academics and career planning. They will also gain research opportunities to explore new fields so that they can eventually choose a track that best matches their skills.</p>
