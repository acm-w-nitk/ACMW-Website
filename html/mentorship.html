			<parabody style="text-align:  left;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type <br> and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but <br>		also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br> the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more <br> recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</parabody>
