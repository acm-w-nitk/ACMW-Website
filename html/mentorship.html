		<parabody style="text-align:  left;">Mentorship system: As an initiative of ACM-W, in order to promote women in technology, we plan to introduce a mentorship system, wherein a junior is paired with a senior from ACM to guide them in their journey through college. We hope to help them with academics, career planning, research opportunities and to explore new fields. This mentorship system gives them an opportunity to interact with seniors that are among the best in their respective fields. It gives them a chance to talk to people that have had first-hand experience with coveted research programmes and internships alike. We help uncover the different tracks for you, so you can eventually choose one.</parabody>
